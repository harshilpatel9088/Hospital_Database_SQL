# Hospital Database System

## Overview

This project aims to design and implement a comprehensive hospital database system to manage healthcare operations efficiently. The database comprises 12 interconnected tables to handle information on patients, doctors, appointments, billing, medical records, prescriptions, rooms, and staff. Advanced techniques, such as normalization (up to 3NF), constraints, triggers, and stored procedures, were used to ensure data integrity and efficiency. Analytical queries and reports provide insights into revenue, patient trends, staff workload, and room occupancy, supporting effective hospital management.

## Features

1. **Data Integrity**  
   Ensuring data accuracy and consistency is paramount. The following measures were implemented:
   - **Normalization**: Applied up to Third Normal Form (3NF) to eliminate redundancy and improve data integrity.
   - **Constraints**: Enforced primary keys, foreign keys, and unique constraints to maintain data accuracy.
   - **Triggers**: Created triggers for automatic enforcement of business rules and consistency.
   - **Stored Procedures**: Developed procedures for routine operations to streamline tasks and maintain data integrity.

2. **Interconnected Tables**  
   The database includes 12 interconnected tables to manage various aspects of hospital operations:
   - **Patients**: Stores patient information.
   - **Doctors**: Stores doctor information.
   - **Appointments**: Manages appointments between patients and doctors.
   - **Billing**: Handles billing details.
   - **Medical Records**: Maintains patient medical records.
   - **Prescriptions**: Tracks prescriptions issued to patients.
   - **Rooms**: Manages hospital room information.
   - **Staff**: Stores staff information.

3. **Analytical Insights**  
   The system provides various analytical queries and reports:
   - **Revenue Reports**: Analyze hospital revenue from billing data.
   - **Patient Trends**: Track patient trends over time.
   - **Staff Workload**: Monitor staff workload and efficiency.
   - **Room Occupancy**: Report on hospital room occupancy rates.
